# Tickerlens — Architectural Decisions

Append-only log. Add a new `##` section for every infra or architectural decision.
Do NOT edit or delete past entries — they record the WHY at the time of the decision.
Git history has the WHAT; this file has the reasoning.

Format:
```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <short title>

**What:** One sentence on what changed or was decided.
**Why:** The motivation — constraint, tradeoff, incident, or requirement.
**Alternatives considered:** What else was evaluated, or "None recorded."
```

## 2026-05-27 — Personal-use scope only

**What:** Productization scope removed; Tickerlens is a single-user research tool for the founder.
**Why:** Reduces complexity dramatically — no auth, no payments, no customer support — and lets the tool prove its value before any commercial commitment.
**Alternatives considered:** SaaS from day one (rejected: too much non-product work before value is demonstrated).

---

## 2026-05-27 — Stack locked

**What:** FastAPI + HTMX + Jinja2 + Tailwind (CDN) + SQLite→Postgres + SQLAlchemy 2.0 + Alembic + Anthropic Claude SDK.
**Why:** HTMX-first keeps the frontend simple without a JS build step. SQLite is sufficient for a single-user tool and trivially migrates to Postgres. `uv` for fast, reproducible dep management.
**Alternatives considered:** Django (heavier), Next.js (overkill for single-user), raw SQL (no migration story).

## 2026-05-27 — CIK as canonical company key

**What:** SEC CIK (zero-padded 10-digit string) is the primary/foreign key for all company joins.
**Why:** Tickers can change and be reused by different companies. CIK is permanent and issued by the SEC.
**Alternatives considered:** Ticker as primary key (rejected: changes and is reused), CUSIP (not freely available from EDGAR).

## 2026-05-31 — Self-built EDGAR parsing over paid API

**What:** Continue building EDGAR extraction in-house rather than switching to a paid data provider (FMP, Finnhub paid).
**Why:** Phase 0 proved AAPL and JNJ work cleanly through `companyfacts`. The concept-mapping layer in `data/xbrl.py` makes tag differences manageable. Paid APIs introduce cost and external dependency.
**Alternatives considered:** Financial Modeling Prep (FMP), Finnhub paid tier — both rejected for cost and lock-in reasons.

## 2026-05-31 — Period joins anchored on `end` date, not `fy/fp`

**What:** Quarterly financial metrics are joined by period `end` date, not by XBRL `fy/fp` label.
**Why:** Comparative facts in amended filings can carry misleading fiscal labels. The `end` date is stable across amendments.
**Alternatives considered:** `fy/fp` label join (rejected: caused mismatches with JNJ comparative facts).

## 2026-06-07 — Earnings download via Chrome headless PDF conversion

**What:** Added `services/ir_download.py` and `scripts/download_earnings.py` for downloading quarterly earnings materials (8-K ex99, 10-Q, 10-K) from EDGAR and converting to PDF via Chrome headless.
**Why:** WeasyPrint can't faithfully render EDGAR HTML with inline XBRL. Chrome produces well-formatted, paginated PDFs (85–153 pages for typical 10-Q/10-K). The download is a research workflow, not a core app feature, so it lives in `scripts/` with supporting service logic in `services/ir_download.py`.
**Alternatives considered:** WeasyPrint (rejected: poor EDGAR HTML rendering); pdfkit/wkhtmltopdf (rejected: unmaintained, same rendering issues); paid IR data services (rejected: cost, violates free-data strategy).

## 2026-06-07 — Pre-push Claude code review system

**What:** Added `.githooks/pre-commit` (Claude diff review), `.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md` (read-only reviewer agent), `.claude/commands/review.md` (/review slash command), docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/DECISIONS.md, and docs/progress/ directory.
**Why:** Catch EDGAR/XBRL regressions, security issues, and undocumented infra changes before they reach git history. Keep the WHY of architectural decisions out of commit messages (which are ephemeral) and into a durable append-only log.
**Alternatives considered:** Manual review discipline (rejected: too easy to skip); GitHub Actions CI review (rejected: no remote CI yet, and hook runs locally at commit time without needing a push).

## 2026-07-01 — Balance-sheet columns on `quarterly_financials`

**What:** Migration `017aee7df1c1` adds `total_assets`, `total_liabilities`, `total_equity`, and `cash_and_equivalents` (all `Float`, nullable) to `quarterly_financials`. These are instant (point-in-time) XBRL facts extracted via the new `balance_sheet_metric()` in `data/xbrl.py`, which calls `concept_facts(instant=True)` to accept facts that carry an `end` but no `start`. `PeriodData` now carries `balance_sheet`, `balance_sheet_yoy`, and `balance_sheet_qoq`; for yearly granularity `balance_sheet_qoq` is always `None` and the value is the year's last quarter (point-in-time, not summed).
**Why:** The detail-view Balance Sheet tab was a stub. Balance-sheet items are instantaneous, so they cannot flow through the duration-based income/cash-flow extraction path or be summed for TTM/yearly aggregates — they need their own extractor and join-by-end handling.
**Alternatives considered:** Reusing the duration extractors with a zero-length window (rejected: instant facts have no `start`, so duration filters drop them); deriving liabilities as assets − equity when the `Liabilities` tag is absent (deferred: adds cross-metric coupling; revisit if a target filer omits the tag).

## 2026-07-04 — Risk Factors extraction pipeline

**What:** Added `data/filings.py`, a new `data/`-layer module that locates the latest 10-K primary document from an EDGAR submissions payload and best-effort extracts Item 1A "Risk Factors" as plain text (regex boundaries + HTML stripping). Two columns — `risk_factors` (Text) and `risk_factors_source` (String 64) — were added to `companies` in migration `d1f5704c5e60`. Extraction runs inside `enrich_company` as a best-effort step: any failure is logged and returns `(None, None)`, never raising, and only overwrites stored values on success so a transient network error cannot wipe a good value.
**Why:** The detail view's collapsible Risk Factors section (PRD §4.3 #6) needs narrative text, which is absent from the structured `companyfacts` API and lives only in the primary filing HTML. Isolating the fragile HTML parsing in `data/` keeps it testable and lets the UI degrade to "Not available for this period" whenever extraction is uncertain.
**Alternatives considered:** Parsing on every page render (rejected: re-parsing a ~1.5 MB 10-K per HTMX swap is wasteful — persist once on enrichment instead); a full HTML parser dependency like BeautifulSoup (deferred: regex stripping is sufficient for section extraction and avoids a new dependency). Known limitation: `latest_annual_filing` scans only `filings.recent`, not the paginated `filings.files` pages, matching the existing `most_recent_10q` behavior. The 8,000-char cap is hardcoded; may move to config if the future AI layer needs more context.

## 2026-07-10 — Press-release highlights on `quarterly_financials`

**What:** Migration `6b81522c5e05` adds `press_release_highlights` (Text) and `press_release_source` (String 64) to `quarterly_financials`. `enrich_press_releases` in `services/financials.py` reuses `ir_download.discover_earnings_filings` to find each quarter's 8-K ex-99 exhibit, extracts plain text via `filings.extract_press_release_text` (EDGAR exhibit-header boilerplate stripped, capped at 4,000 chars), and stores it against the matching quarter by period end date. Runs on the refresh route only (not first-visit auto-fetch) to keep first page loads fast; failures are logged and skipped, and stored values are only overwritten on successful extraction.
**Why:** The detail view's "Press release highlights" disclosure (PRD §4.3 #6) needed per-quarter content. Unlike risk factors (company-level, latest 10-K), press releases are inherently per-period, so they live on `quarterly_financials`, not `companies`.
**Alternatives considered:** Storing only the latest quarter's release on `companies` (rejected: the time slicer shows historical quarters, each needs its own release); summarizing "highlights" with the LLM (deferred to Phase 5 AI analysis — raw opening text is useful now and the LLM can consume the stored text later).
