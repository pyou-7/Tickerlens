## Current Phase

**Phase 2 — Single-company browsing UI**

Goal: a usable Overview page and Time Slicer detail view for one company, single-period mode first. Range and Compare modes are deferred to Phase 3.

---

## What's done

- PRD written and refined (`docs/PRD_Tickerlens.md` — v1.0 personal scope)
- Working context captured in `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, and `docs/AGENT_HANDOFF.md`
- Stack chosen and locked (see `CLAUDE.md`)
- Claude Code context configured (`CLAUDE.md` + `.claude/`)
- Phase 0 EDGAR feasibility passed with AAPL and JNJ notebooks
- **Phase 1 complete** — data flows end-to-end for one company:
  - `data/edgar.py`, `data/xbrl.py`, `data/sic.py`, `data/wikipedia.py`, `data/yahoo.py`
  - `models/` (Company, QuarterlyFinancial) + Alembic migrations
  - `services/financials.py` (`fetch_and_persist`, `enrich_company`, `get_overview`, `get_detail`)
  - `tests/` — 36 passing (XBRL + financials service)
- **Phase 2 in progress:**
  - Overview page (PRD §4.1): header, description, latest-quarter KPI cards w/ YoY, TTM snapshot
  - Time Slicer detail view (PRD §4.3): quarterly/yearly selectors, HTMX swap, Plotly revenue+EPS trend, hero KPIs, tabbed Income/Cash Flow tables — single-period mode

---

## What's next (concrete Phase 2 tasks)

1. ~~**Balance Sheet tab** in the detail view~~ *(done — merged in PR #1)*
2. ~~**QoQ toggle** on the hero KPI row~~ *(done — merged in PR #2)*
3. ~~**Detail collapsible sections** with Risk Factors extraction~~ *(done — merged in PR #3; press release/guidance/transcript sections show "Not available" pending content sources)*
4. **Press-release highlights content** for the collapsible section — extract from the matched 8-K ex-99 exhibit (infra exists in `services/ir_download.py`).
5. **Sticky Download button** in the detail view (PRD §4.3 #7) — note: full ZIP download is Phase 3; keep this to a simple per-period PDF link or defer.
6. *(deferred)* pin Python to exactly 3.12 in `pyproject.toml requires-python` (currently `>=3.12`).

**Deferred (founder decision 2026-07-10):** Revenue breakdown card (PRD §4.1 #5) — segment revenue is NOT in the `companyfacts` API (verified 2026-07: no dimensional facts; geography tags are annual-only and missing for most filers). Requires a raw-XBRL dimension parser. **Deferred past Phase 2** — do NOT build; revisit after Phase 3. Phase 2 closes without it. Period selector stays detail-view-only (confirmed same date).

Do NOT build Range/Compare modes, search, watchlist, AI analysis, calendar, or news feed — those are Phase 3+.

## Open decisions

- Final tagline (3 candidates parked in PRD)
- Domain & trademark registration for "Tickerlens"
- Hosting (local Docker on home machine vs. Hetzner $5/mo vs. Vercel free)
- Whether to commercialize — explicitly deferred until tool proves useful

## Recent decisions (most recent first)

| Date | Decision |
|---|---|
| 2026-06-29 | Reconciled `PROJECT_STATUS.md` with actual state: Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 (Overview + Time Slicer detail) in progress. Set up a daily scheduled cloud agent that picks one Phase 2 task and opens a PR for review |
| 2026-05-31 | Added `docs/AGENT_HANDOFF.md` as the concise current-state handoff for Codex, Claude Code, Gemini, and future agents |
| 2026-05-31 | Moved Phase 0 notebook logic into reusable modules: `data/edgar.py`, `data/xbrl.py`, and `services/financials.py`; XBRL joins are anchored by period end date |
| 2026-05-31 | Phase 0 EDGAR decision gate passed: AAPL and JNJ both work with `companyfacts`; continue self-built EDGAR into Phase 1, with explicit concept mapping and period-label handling |
| 2026-05-27 | Pivoted scope to personal-use only; productization PRD archived for possible future revival |
| 2026-05-27 | Stack locked: FastAPI + HTMX + Jinja2 + Tailwind + SQLite/Postgres |
| 2026-05-27 | Product name = Tickerlens (pending domain/TM check) |
| 2026-05-27 | Free-data strategy: EDGAR + Wikipedia + Yahoo + NAICS + Finnhub free tier |
| 2026-05-27 | AI analysis ships in v1.0 (not deferred — single-user, no need to gate behind paid tier) |
| 2026-05-27 | 3-year historical depth, 2 selectors (quarterly + yearly), 3 modes (single / range / compare) |
| 2026-05-27 | CIK as canonical company key (not ticker) |
